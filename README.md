<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mackenzie McClemont!</h1>

<p>Based in Toronto, Ontario I bring 5+ years of experience in client-facing roles in a variety of industries. As someone who champions diversity and inclusion I hope to use my skills to create a more accessible web landscape for everyone to enjoy. I excel in cross functional and challenging data-driven positions and Iâ€™m always working towards learning more technologies and improving my toolkit as a developer.</p>
